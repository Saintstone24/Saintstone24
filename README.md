## Quick facts ‚ö°

- Recently graduated in Computer and System engineering (Bachelor Level) in Sapienza, University of Rome
- Contributed in the making of `NsOranEnv`, a gymnasium-compliant environment for 5G O-RAN simulations ([details](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10619796))
- I am fluent in both English (CEFR level C1, as of October 2024) and Italian, which is my mother tongue. I am also practicing German in my day to day life in Switzerland.

## About Me üìù

I am interested in applying the results of machine learning, data science and cybersecurity to create and improve all kinds of systems, from network and cloud-based infrastructures to physical, tiny embedded systems. My goal is to improve the world through well-designed, innovative and human-centred technology. When I'm not doing that, I enjoy working on personal projects that usually revolve around creating and telling stories, whether through pen and paper, photography, or something else.

## More details

I'm most familiar with C, Java and Python and I am keen to extend my knowledge to other languages and workflows. I've had experience in software and data engineering, both creating application architectures using UML and Java, and databases using the Entity Relationship (ER) diagram alongside SQL-based engines such as PostgreSQL. I have also experimented with Docker, Latex and Markdown. Each of the other tools mentioned has been used in projects mainly related to the technology mentioned here.
